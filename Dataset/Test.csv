1,'Till I Collapse,Eminem,299,angry,"Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.  Till I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em Cuz when I am not, then Ima stop pinnin them and I am not hip-hop and Im not just Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin em, women are caught in webs, spin em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not Get the illin to stop, amoxacillins just not real enough The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners Your comin with me, feel it or not youre gonna fear it Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot lyrics to shock, Is it a miracle Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up? Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot Listen up, You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a  fuck  Till the roof comes off, Till the lights go out Till my leg give out Cant shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out And my high burn out Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off Till the lights go out Till my legs give out Cant shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out Am I high, perhaps? Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse  Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin You get when youre real, And you spit and people are feelin ya shit This is your moment and every single minute You spend trynna hold on to it cuz you may never get it again So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over Just admit when its at its end Cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in I got a list Heres the order of my list that its in  It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me But in this industry, Im the cause of a lotta Envy So when Im not put on this list The shit does not offend me Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins Botherin me, even though half You people gotta fuckin problem with me You hate it but you know respect you got to Give me The press wet dream like Bobby and Whitney Nate hit me Till the roof comes off, Till the lights go out Till my leg give out Cant shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out And my high burn out Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off Till the lights go out Till my legs give out Cant shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out Am I high, perhaps Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse  Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's Heart, what is he thinkin', how Not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my Spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth That would be the death of me first 'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could Ever be worse that's why I'm Clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack, Like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin' On them, the track is on some Battlin' rap who wants some static 'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so Till the roof comes off, Till the lights go out Till my leg give out Can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out And my high burn out I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off Till the lights go out Till my legs give out Can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out Am I high, perhaps? I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse  Until the roof, (Until the roof) the roof comes off (The roof comes off) Until my legs, (Until my legs) give out from underneath me, I, I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me "

3,A Century Ends,David Gray,308,angry,"Cast your eyes into the distance Try to focus on it all Find a spirit of resistance Instead of pride before the fall Forge some opposition From disparate strands It ain't the prettiest position As a century ends  Unstable situation Faces made of wax Streams of melting glass Sheets of butchered facts The roar of the machine Hooded hearts and jewelled hands And anger spilling out like gasoline As a century ends  Everything i seen, everything that i heard, Ain't even the tip of the iceberg Fire down memory lane So pass me my rose tinted glasses again  Through a fog of contradiction Out to the lake of tears See society admiring its own reflection Chase a light that shines and disappears Careful what you say 'cos reality offends Just sit back and let your soul decay As a century ends  And its easy to get weary As you fight to get it done gainst a popular theory That it's over 'fore it's even begun Strain the limit of compassion Tend a wound that never mends And honesty still out of fashion As a century ends As a century ends As a century ends....

Then again it might just be a bunch of back slappin', When I walk through that door. Here the same old stories, That keep gettin' bigger than they were before.

Dare to be one of us, girl, Facing the Andrum's conundrum, Ah, I feel like I should just cry, But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin, Youâre humoring your cote, You don't know how long I've been, Watching the lantern dim, Starved of oxygen, So give me your hand, And let's jump out the window.

It was sadder than the morning doe, Much funnier than a clown. But when push comes to shove, Oh, I still love this town. Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do do do do do  I was waitin' on the eastbound train, Headed out to see the suburbs, When I thought I heard my name. It was just a crazy lady slurrin' words. It was sadder than a weepin' willow. As silly as a dog with a bone. But when you ask me 'bout it, I'll still call this my home. Do do do do Do do do do do do do do Oh oh Do do do do Do do do do do do do do Early mornin' on a Saturday, The bustle wakes us up in bed. Construction, trucks, kids in the park at play, No quiet place to lay our heads.

56,Shades Of Gray,The Monkees,199,happy,"When the world and I were young, Just yesterday.  Life was such a simple game, A child could play.  It was easy then to tell right from wrong. Easy then to tell weak from strong. When a man should stand and fight, Or just go along.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. I remember when the answers seemed so clear  We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear. It was easy then to tell truth from lies Selling out from compromise Who to love and who to hate,  The foolish from the wise.  But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. [Instumental interlude]  It was easy then to know what was fair When to keep and when to share. How much to protect your heart And how much to care. But today there is no day or night Today there is no dark or light. Today there is no black or white, Only shades of gray. Only shades of gray. "

We need time, only time Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on? All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  So tell me darling, do you wish weâd fall in love? Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, Iâve never felt so at home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When weâre apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish weâd fall in love?

I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe When you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him Throw him down pin him So lost in the moments when you're in them It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday Yesterday is over it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you ?? the game Now you get to watch her leave out the window I guess that's why they call it window pain Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me But when it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk I told you this is my fault Look me in the eye ball Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall Next time. There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie  I love the way you lie  "

I wish we could open our eyes To see in all directions at the same time Oh what a beautiful view If you were never aware of what was around you And it is true what you said That I live like a hermit in my own head But when the sun shines again I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in.

Bring you back to the bar. Get you out of the cold. A sober ,straight face gets you out of your clothes. And theyï¼re scared that we know all the crimes theyï¼ll commit. Who theyï¼ll kiss before they get home. I will lie awake. Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say. Barely conscious in the door where you stand. Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands. You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute. I almost feel sorry for what Iï¼m gonna do. And your hair smells of smoke. Who will cast the first stone? You can sin or spend the night all alone. Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone. Youï¼re using all your looks that youï¼ve thrown from the start. If you let me have my way, I swear Iï¼ll tear you apart. Cause itï¼s all you can be.  Youï¼re a drunk and youï¼re scared. Itï¼s ladies night. All the girls drink for free. I will lie awake. And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you. Let you fall for every empty word I say.  I will lie awake.

Losing what was found, a world so hollow, Suspended in a compromise. The silence of this sound is soon to follow, Somehow sundown.

A reflection of a lie will keep me waiting. With love gone for so long.  And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know. Knowing that faith is all that I hold.  Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding. Fall into your sunlight. BY ç£ç³ç§ç¦ "

(I know, I know...) (It's OK, it's OK...)  "

8,A Thousand Kisses Deep,Leonard Cohen,386,relaxed,"The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat. You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. You lose your grip, and then you slip Into the Masterpiece. And maybe I had miles to drive, And promises to keep: You ditch it all to stay alive, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  Confined to sex, we pressed against The limits of the sea: I saw there were no oceans left For scavengers like me. I made it to the forward deck. I blessed our remnant fleet And then consented to be wrecked, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, I'm back on Boogie Street. I guess they won't exchange the gifts That you were meant to keep. And quiet is the thought of you, The file on you complete, Except what we forgot to do, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  And sometimes when the night is slow, The wretched and the meek, We gather up our hearts and go, A Thousand Kisses Deep.  The ponies run, the girls are young, The odds are there to beat...  You win a while, and then it's done Your little winning streak. And summoned now to deal With your invincible defeat, You live your life as if it's real A Thousand Kisses Deep.  "
