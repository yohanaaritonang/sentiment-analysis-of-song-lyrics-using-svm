1,All Messed Up,Sum 41,164,angry,Another day wasted out of time I can't get out of this Altered state of mind I'm going overboard My conscience meets decline Into reality I know this can't be fine Cause I'm all messed up Making prefect nonsense Drowning in my doubt too well Cause I'm all messed up Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind So blind Who are these voices in my head I can't go on like this Living like the dead I haven't slept so long Feeling sad I dread I'm talking to myself Forgot what I just said Cause I'm all messed up Making prefect nonsense Drowning in my doubt too well Cause I'm all messed up Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind So blind Well I hold my only enemy as closely as a friend And I sold my own reality to further my descent Self-destruction taking over it's so easy to pretend Introduction to this nightmare may never end Can anyone help me drag my heels I'm running overtime I can't hold down my meals My mind is racing by Staring blankly feels Like pulling out my teeth While this engine winds Cause I'm all messed up Making prefect nonsense Drowning in my doubt too well Cause I'm all messed up Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind So blind

Crumblinâ apart from pressure of the blaster, waiting for a sign.And the momentary pleasures take their turn, As the wistful boy runs out of things to learn. The episodes of your are never to return. Scare up some hope, Youâre gonna need it just to cope, You are the decision, numbers donât rely. When you bite the dust, Wasnât the purpose all for trust, Youâll never relive it, Think before you die. Yeah, think, think before you die.  Deficit and depravation, In the wake of desperation. We write the morals rectify the nation, Now may be a time. As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time, Do you wonder how your life has been defined? You know eternity canât ever change your mind. You know eternity canât ever change your mind. So, think, think before you die. Whoa, think, think before you die.  "

Look at the times. Sick is the mind of the motha fuckin' kid that's behind all this commotion. Emotions run deep as ocean's explodin.' Tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin.' Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin. Keep kickin' ass in the mornin,' an' takin' names in the evening. Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth.

So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it, I'ma expose it. I'll take you back to 73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch, cuz he split. I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye. No, I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die. I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side. Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake. I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human. But I'm man enough to face them today. /What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb but the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun. Cuz id'a killed 'em,  shit I would have shot Kim an' him both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show. I'm sorry, Mama. I never meant to hurt you.

Going through  public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up,  now I blew up. It makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma? But guess what, yer gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely. An' Nathan's getting' up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney. And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral. See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong. Bitch, do ya song. Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit.  Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what, I am dead.  Dead to you as can be. I'm sorry, Mama. I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet.  one more time  I'm sorry, Mama. I never meant to hurt you.

I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs, Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying, Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here. I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors, I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care? I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie, I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, Shit..

It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up, Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled. Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed, They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust, Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that, He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first, But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse, Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills.

And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do, I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is, Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low. I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD, Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive. And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright. And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night, I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right, I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.

I think about the things I would never got to say to you, I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do. Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too, I still love your mother, that'll never change, Think about her every day, we just could never get it together. Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it, But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on anyday. There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains, Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain. But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame, I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint. I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history, But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say, I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way. But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..  I'm going through changes Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willin' to be the bigger man If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin' Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers "

Through the week and can't get away And you're alone on the pier In West Palm Beach on your holiday Stormy night, reawake the stomach ache that i've acquired from feeling down, things look grim and i'm so sick of being tired apartment lights go dark and it's depressing but what can i do? the midnight streets feel dead when i am so used to driving with you brighter lights fill the night and bluer skys reflect in your eyes As I inspect and analyze All of these dreams I don't recognize if you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail inside my head you're voice is still resounding but what can i do? Empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun and think of me when you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea Can you still hear my voice when I'm outside from over the phone For what its worth darling dear I wish you were here Cause I feel alone when you were home we'd sing but since you've left I don't hear anything Though I feel so sad, I can't believe things are really that bad Old captains and brand new cruise ships Sailing over the briney sea When I crashed my beloved desk job And swim through the debris I'll cut loose leave this mad house,bound for the Atlantic blue I'll stroll down your treelined driveway and sail the ocean with you Happy Chinese Valentine's Day!

And You answer: ""My child, I love you. And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace  At times I may grow weak and feel a bit discouraged, Knowing that someone, somewhere Could do a better job. For who am I to serve You? I know I don't deserve You.

And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace you are so Patient with me, Lord.  As I work with You, I'm learning what Your grace really means. The price that I could never pay was paid at Calvary. So, instead of trying to repay You, I'm learning to simply obey You By giving up my life to You For all that giving to me I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you.

Nobody knows  Sun been down for days A winter melody she plays The thunder makes her contemplate She hears a noise behind the gate Perhaps a letter with a dove Perhaps a stranger she could love  And She fights for her life As she puts on her coat And she fights for her life on the train She looks at the rain As it pours And she fights for her life As she goes in a store With a thought she has caught By a thread She pays for the bread And She goes...

So you empty the roads leading the craft for truth.  Cause I donât have wings to fly so freely like birds in the sky. Iâll have to let go of mind to soar in the wind and smile.  Approaching to a child, ignoring the crowd. I hear my heart beats, itâs so real. Nameless song, Iâve sung it over the way.  "
